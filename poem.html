        <h1>Wise Wisdom</h1>
        <p id="p1">
            The linguistic lingual longing of the doorway—'our dull distinct desire;' <br>
            Seeking a sweet string of delightful dawn does not define us as defier. <br>
            Faith in fate engulfed by bitter fails, indulges in time's ink; <br>
            Though denying dreams peaks over our verity, via frequent blinks. 
        </p>
        <p id="p2">
            Initial invitation of your—devise an encounter by enchantments; <br>
            Of believed false paths, led by us blind ants. <br>
            Life of lies began to metaphorize the browed brute truth; <br>
            Yet you yield a peaceful presence, portrayed as rebellious ruth. 
        </p>
        <p id="p3">
            Mythical, mystical narrative navigation of your; <br>
            Was knowledge of singularity, we hovered over its horizon, ne'er sung bore on shore. <br>
            The sleek stupendous shrine of our meritorious mind; <br>
            Pulchritudinously firmly framed by you, nebulae—rare to find. 
        </p>
        <p id="p4">
            Us bare bud, blunt shallow wanderers were seized in your shelter; <br>
            You, ensconced, craft our second draft: a curious drama, 'worthy, wordable writer.' <br>
            We quintessentially hinges to be quasars, hanging, roaming around you; <br>
            ‘Cause of you, our view found a clue, by sand dropped, emerged to this cosmic hue. 
        </p>
        <p id="p5">
            Albeit, always an uncertainty was lying by shady scarcely occasion; <br>
            A momentarily flashy fury as supernovae’s explosion. <br>
            The wise, a one ought to be dear; <br>
            Ironically forging drey, a point of fear. 
        </p>
        <p id="p6">
            The persona phase was devoid of ease; <br>
            But crucially critical, indeed for our great lease. <br>
            Bright, blossy, blissful were in—that you kept hidden inside; <br>
            Still, sometimes we got a glimpse—a beautiful sight so wide. 
        </p>
        <p id="p6">
            Forgiveness is a virtue, a lone, lovely way; <br>
            The gale has to hesitate to be a tale of any's bae. <br>
            These mere glances nourish us to mesmerize; <br>
            Enlighten ourselves via these; rescue—resign harsh disguise. 
        </p>
        <p id="p7">
            In the eclipse, you stand, attracts, a true allure; <br>
            An invincible individual ambushes evil, a heart of pure. <br>
            Dreadful, drained, pitched obscure, was pleasant to your luminescence; <br>
            Enhanced, ‘atrocious away,’ privilege of our, ‘embrace the essence.’ 
        </p>
        <p id="p8">
            Forth far, a fallen angel, one forsaken divinity; <br>
            Aside, we could grasp; your art of almighty. <br>
            The hyperbole is grim for referring to your elucidation; <br>
            Word ‘perfect’ departures; flourishes its ensuing of delusionation.
        </p>
        <p id="p9">
            Deep beneath, before we knew, a holy depiction harvested our blue; <br>
            Heritage of wisdom, a high 'historical ethereal ocean' of merit mystery, 'our crew'. 
        </p>
        <p id="p10">
            Said by folks, “Big Bang was a begetter—a birth.” <br>
            Therefore, we conclude your wisdom’s declaration—vary worth. 
        </p>
